# Migration to Expo Router with SafeAreaView

## Overview
Successfully migrated the Todo App from React Navigation to Expo Router with proper SafeAreaView implementation following the official Expo Router documentation.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Installed Expo Router
- Added `expo-router` dependency
- Updated `app.json` to include the app scheme for deep linking

### 2. Restructured Navigation Architecture
**Before (React Navigation):**
```
App.tsx
├── NavigationContainer
└── RootNavigator
    ├── AuthStack (Login, Register, ForgotPassword)
    └── AppStack (TodoList, Profile - Bottom Tabs)
```

**After (Expo Router):**
```
app/
├── _layout.tsx (Root layout with SafeAreaProvider)
├── index.tsx (Initial route handler)
├── +not-found.tsx (404 handler)
├── (auth)/
│   ├── _layout.tsx (Auth stack layout)
│   ├── login.tsx
│   ├── register.tsx
│   └── forgot-password.tsx
└── (tabs)/
    ├── _layout.tsx (Tab layout)
    ├── index.tsx (Todo list - main tab)
    └── profile.tsx
```

### 3. Implemented SafeAreaView Correctly
- Wrapped all screens with `SafeAreaView` from `react-native-safe-area-context`
- Added `SafeAreaProvider` at the root level in `app/_layout.tsx`
- Ensured proper safe area handling for notches, status bars, and device-specific elements

### 4. Updated Navigation
- Replaced `navigation.navigate()` with Expo Router's `Link` component and `router.push()`
- Used file-based routing instead of programmatic navigation setup
- Implemented route groups for better organization

### 5. Entry Point Changes
- Updated `index.js` to use `expo-router/entry`
- Moved initialization logic from `App.tsx` to `app/_layout.tsx`
- Backed up original `App.tsx` as `App.tsx.backup`

### 6. Cleaned Up Dependencies
- Removed React Navigation dependencies:
  - `@react-navigation/native`
  - `@react-navigation/native-stack`
  - `@react-navigation/bottom-tabs`

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Proper Safe Area Handling**: All screens now properly handle device safe areas
2. **File-based Routing**: More intuitive navigation structure based on file system
3. **Universal Deep Linking**: All routes are accessible via URLs
4. **Better TypeScript Support**: Expo Router provides better type safety
5. **Simplified Architecture**: Reduced boilerplate code for navigation setup
6. **Web Support**: Automatic web support with URL-based routing

## How to Test

1. Run the app: `npm start`
2. Verify authentication flow: login → tabs → logout → login
3. Test all navigation links and back buttons
4. Verify safe areas are working correctly on devices with notches
5. Test deep linking with URLs (web) or custom schemes (mobile)

## File Structure Compliance

The new structure follows Expo Router conventions:
- `app/_layout.tsx`: Root layout (replaces App.tsx)
- `app/index.tsx`: Default route
- `app/(auth)/`: Route group for authentication (doesn't affect URL)
- `app/(tabs)/`: Route group for authenticated tabs
- `app/+not-found.tsx`: 404 error handling

All screens now properly implement SafeAreaView for consistent UI across different devices and orientations.
